<h2>See3D: Creating Hands-on Access through the Power of 3D Printing</h2>
<p>by Caroline Karbowski</p>
<p><strong><img src="caroline-karbowski.jpg" alt="Caroline Karbowski displays 3D models at an exhibition." width="468" height="351" align="right"/>From the Editor: For several years a number of organizations  have offered downloadable files that can be used to create 3-dimensional models  through 3D printing. From amebas to galaxies, nearly anything can be rendered  in a form that is tactilely accessible. But few people have access to a 3D  printer or possess the expertise to turn a file into an actual object. For most  blind people, the promise of access through 3D printing has remained  unfulfilled. </strong></p>
<p>Caroline Karbowski is an undergraduate student at The Ohio  State University. In this article she explains how she founded a nonprofit  called See3D. See3D is dedicated to getting 3-dimensional models into the hands  of the blind people who want and need them.</p>
<p>It may seem unusual for someone who is sighted to read  Braille by touch, but I didn't think twice about it when I was in sixth grade.  I wanted to be able to read books in the car without getting carsick. I figured  that if I learned Braille, I could read to my heart's content on family trips.</p>
<p>I learned Braille on my own, and I have been using it ever  since. To this day I read Braille at night before I fall asleep. I use Braille  to rehearse my theater lines backstage. I even labeled the controls in my car  in Braille so I can keep my eyes on the road while I drive! </p>
<p>When I was in eighth grade I read an article on how 3D  printing could make tactile models of images seen through a telescope or  microscope. The models could be labeled in Braille for blind users. I realized  I could label 3D-printed models and distribute them to people who are blind. </p>
<p>The technology club at my high school had a 3D printer. I  was eager to put it to use, but I couldn't decide what I wanted to print. Then  I remembered the article I had read the year before, and I realized I could use  our printer to make 3D models for blind people. I built on this idea when I led  a showcase project at TechOlympics, the area high school technology conference.  Our technology team created a website, see3d.org. On this website anyone who is  blind or anyone who is a parent/guardian or teacher of someone who is blind,  can request a model. We can then print it, add Braille labels or descriptions  as needed, and mail the model using Free Matter shipping. </p>
<p>After we presented at TechOlympics, we were invited to other  maker events. I met a number of visitors who volunteered to print and design  models. A woman named Emily Kiehl offered to improve our website. </p>
<p>At the start of the project I didn't actually know anyone  who was blind. Then I met a blind woman at a college event, and she offered to  give me feedback on a Cinderella Castle model. She introduced me to some of her  blind friends. My mother connected me with some friends of hers who are  teachers of blind students. </p>
<p>I wanted to learn about the educational tools currently  being used for blind students, so I visited several schools and toured the  American Printing House for the Blind in Louisville, Kentucky. I also visited  the Digital Fabrication Lab at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually  Impaired (ISBVI). These visits gave me a clearer idea of how See3D could  contribute to the availability of tactile learning tools. </p>
<p>At college I met a fellow student, Garrett Carder, who also  offered to help with the website. Together we pitched for seed funding from The  Innovation Studio at The Ohio State University (OSU). The funding helped us  purchase 3D printing materials and convention admission fees. In addition, The  Innovation Studio connected us with the Entrepreneurial Business Law Clinic at  OSU, which helped us file to become a tax-exempt, nonprofit 501(c)3  organization. </p>
<p>Today, See3D has distributed more than six hundred models to  blind people. We have filled requests from individuals, large group requests  for conferences and schools, and a bit of everything in between. </p>
<p>Our most frequent requests are for models of things that  cannot be touched or fully understood through touch in real life due to safety  concerns or the size, cost, or delicate nature of the object. Most popular are  butterflies, cells, sea creatures, DNA molecules, monuments, maps, buildings,  snowflakes, and, of course, movie characters. We have designed a few original  models, but our design capability is limited by the availability and ability of  our volunteers. Mostly we print models that are available under Public Domain  or Creative Commons licenses. Our main printing material is called PLA  filament. We use cloud-based printers, so multiple people can load objects and  control the printers. We are always looking for more volunteers to help design  and print models, create Braille labels, and put packages in the mail. </p>
<p>Once a model has been designed on the computer, it can be  posted online for anyone to download or modify. The files for 3D printing,  which are known as STL files, are easily transferred electronically. In many  cases we can fulfill a request without actually printing and mailing the model,  as long as the recipient has a 3D printer. We fulfill many of our international  requests by sending files to be printed. In other instances we send models with  people who are traveling to the country where they are needed. We have sent  actual models to places as far-flung as Kyrgyzstan, Guatemala, Canada, and  Guyana. Through 3D printing students around the world can use the same models  and collaborate on improvements. </p>
<p>Recently we have been working with the Model Club at the  Ohio State School for the Blind (OSSB). We demonstrate to the students and  teachers how to operate their 3D printers. Students use screen readers and  magnifiers to find STL files online, which they load into a slicer for  printing. However, slicing programs often are inaccessible to users of screen  readers. We are collaborating with 3D printing companies to help eliminate such  barriers. </p>
<p>In the past another barrier in the printing process was the  inaccessibility of 3D printers themselves. The maintenance controls and file  names had to be selected on the printer's screen. During this school year we  were able to connect the printer to a computer, so all of the printer functions  could be controlled with a screen reader. Some students also use video call apps  such as Aira to navigate the printer screen. This method allows students to be  independent and discover more functions of the printer. </p>
<p>OSSB has a large collection of models of historical  landmarks. Last year we mainly printed smaller replicas of the large models in  the collection. Students can have their own personal copies of the smaller 3D  printed models, and they can gain a general idea of the shape before they use  the larger model for detail. Currently, students are printing models that  interest them and models their teachers have requested for use in the  classroom. </p>
<p>I'm a biology major, and I want to get involved in science  education. This past summer Emily Kiehl and I led science activities at the  2019 BELL Academy of the NFB of Ohio. The highlight was a dogfish shark  dissection. We wanted to expose the students to the shapes of different kinds  of sharks, so we printed models of a manta ray, a whale shark, and a dogfish  shark. We also showed them a dogfish shark as a tactile graphic. In this way the  students were able to make connections between the 2D graphic, the 3D model,  and the actual shark specimen. We decided to expand on this concept by printing  models of human organs, including the eye, the intestine, the stomach, a  neuron, and the cochlea. During the children's activities at the NFB of Ohio  convention we paired these models with the images in a book of tactile anatomy  graphics.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We have discovered that 3D printing can be a means to boost  awareness about blindness. When we go to maker events, we spread awareness  about Braille, web accessibility, and tactile learning. Many of the people who  contact See3D to help print models have no personal connection with blindness.  I realized 3D printing can become a great connection between people who are  blind and those who are sighted. People of all ages and 3D printing abilities  can become involved with See3D. Middle-school students have designed model  requests. Since most requests already have a design available, a volunteer just  needs to have access to a 3D printer to create the model itself. Our blind  volunteers print models using screen readers and use video call apps to work  around aspects that are not accessible yet. As we design and print models to be  touched, it is our hope that more people are becoming aware of blindness and  see the value of making the world more accessible. </p>
